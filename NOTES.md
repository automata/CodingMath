Episodes 2-3: Trigonometry
===

Study of triangles. Relationship between sides and angles of triangles.

```                  B
                    /|                    sin A = opposite / hypotenuse
   hypotenuse    /   |
               /    _| opposite edge      cos A = adjacent / hypotenuse
            /      |.|
          A ---------                     tan A = opposite / adjacent
               adjacent edge


  degrees = (radians * 180) / PI

  radians = (degrees * PI) / 180

```

If we graph the sin A values considering 0-360 degrees, we get the sine wave.

Episode 4: Curves, ellipses, Lissajous curves
===

When we change the amount of coordinates position of a curve ramdonly, we have a Lissajous curve.
